          Here is a technique for doing a search-and-replace inside a git repository. I find myself doing this a few
          times a year and it's rare enough that I alwasy forget the exact commands. So I thought I'd write it down here
          for posterity.
        </p>

        <h2><abbr title="too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr></h2>

        <pre><code>git grep -l SEARCH | xargs sed -i s/SEARCH/REPLACE/g</code></pre>

        <p>If you want more details, keep reading.</p>

        <h2>The problem</h2>

        <p>
          Say you're doing a refactor in your code, or you some major overhaul of your documentation, and you find
          yourself wanting to do a search and replace across all files in your repository.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's say for example that you've been hard at work developing a cool new web framework called
          <code>jingo</code> (it stands for "javascript inspired network graph object" in case you were wondering). One
          day you realize with horror that the name you've chosen is awfully similar to another popular framework. So
          just to be safe, you decide to rename your project and change its name to <code>flosk</code> ("forward logic
          object software kit"). Now it's time to update all your code and documentation!
        </p>

        <h2>My solution</h2>

        <p>
          I imagine that today's fancy text editors have built-in ways to do these kinds of refactors, but personally I
          don't use a fancy text editor and I think it's useful to know how to do this "by hand".
        </p>

        <p>
          My solution is to break the problem into two parts. First, find all the occurences of the text I want to
          remove (<code>jingo</code> in my example from earlier), then replace that text with the new one
          (<code>flosk</code>).
        </p>

        <h3>Search with <code>git grep ...</code></h3>

        <p>
          The classic tool for finding text in a series of files is <code>grep</code>, but in this case I will use
          <code>git grep</code> because it has some useful defaults when dealing with a git repository. In theory all
          the examples should work using plain <code>grep</code> but might require a bit of extra work.
        </p>

        <pre><code>git grep jingo</code></pre>

        <p>
          This will find all occurences of <code>jingo</code> in any file inside the git repository, and show (by
          default) the name of the file and the line that contains the text.
        </p>

        <p>
          I my case I don't want to see the match, just the list of files. That's what the
          <code>--files-with-match</code> flag is for (<code>-l</code> for short):
        </p>

        <pre><code>git grep -l jingo</code></pre>

        <h3>Replace with <code>sed</code></h3>

        <p>
          The classic tool for doing search-and-replace inside a file is the unix utility <code>sed</code>. It's a
          powerful tool but it can also be a little tricky to use. It has its own mini language to write commands that
          modify the file you give it in different ways. It calls those commands "expressions", and the first letter of
          the expression tells you what kind of operation is done. In our case we will use the <code>s</code> command
          which stands for "substitute". I have also used the <code>d</code> command in the past for deleting specific
          lines.
        </p>

        <pre><code> sed 's/jingo/flosk/g' README.txt</code></pre>

        <p>
          By default, <code>sed</code> will not modify any files you give it. Instead it applies the command you gave it
          to the file, and shows the modified version leaving the original file intact. For our use case we actually
          want to modfiy the file, so we need to give <code>sed</code> the <code>--in-place</code> option (<code
            >-i</code
          >
          for short):
        </p>

        <pre><code> sed -i 's/jingo/flosk/g' README.txt</code></pre>

        <h3>Putting it together with <code>xargs</code></h3>

        <p>
          We're almost there! With <code>git grep ...</code> we can find the files, and with <code>sed ...</code> we can
          search/replace inside one file. All we need is to "glue" the two together and run the <code>sed</code> command
          on each file. One way I like to do it is using the <code>xargs</code> command:
        </p>

        <pre><code>git grep -l jingo | xargs sed -i 's/jingo/flosk/g'</code></pre>

        <h2>Going a bit further</h2>

        <h3>Dealing with files containing spaces in their names</h3>

        <p>
          Because of the way <code>xargs</code> works, the command I've shown will break if any of the matched files
          contains a space in their name. For example if the file is called <code>READ ME.txt</code> then
          <code>xargs</code> will tell <code>sed</code> to open two files: <code>READ</code> and <code>ME.txt</code>.
          One solution for this is to tell <code>git grep</code> to use a special character to separate the file names
          (instead of putting one file name per line), and to tell <code>xargs</code> to use that same character for
          splitting the list of files names back into individual ones before passing them to <code>sed</code>. The
          character used is called a "null byte" and is normally not allowed in file names.
        </p>

        <p>
          The option is called <code>--null</code> for both <code>git grep</code> and <code>xargs</code>, but
          unfortunately its short version is not the same with both tools: <code>git grep</code> uses
          <code>-z</code> while <code>xargs</code> uses <code>-0</code> (a zero).
        </p>

        <p>Here's how our example looks like now:</p>

        <pre><code>git grep -lz jingo | xargs -0 sed -i 's/jingo/flosk/g'</code></pre>

        <h3>Restricting the target files</h3>

        <p>
          Because we use <code>git grep</code>, we can use its full power when it comes to targetting specific files
          (what git calls "<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-grep#Documentation/git-grep.txt-ltpathspecgt82308203"
            >pathspecs</a
          >"). For example let's say we only want to target python files:
        </p>

        <pre><code>git grep -l jingo -- '*.py' | xargs sed -i 's/jingo/flosk/g'</code></pre>

        <h3>More complex search/replace with regular expressions</h3>

        <p>
          So far we've used fixed strings for both search and replace, but sometimes you need a bit of extra power.
          Luckily both git and sed have support for regular expressions: git has <code>--extended-regexp</code> while
          sed has <code>--regexp-extended</code>. It's a bit annoying that they use different names, but luckily the
          short name of the flag is the same for both: <code>-E</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an example, here is how you can replace all instances of both <code>jingo</code> and
          <code>JINGO</code> with <code>flosk</code>:
        </p>

        <pre><code>git grep -l -E '(jingo|JINGO)' | xargs sed -i -E 's/(jingo|JINGO)/flosk/g'</code></pre>

        <p>
          To use capture groups in the replacement sed command, we can use <code>\1</code> (and <code>\2</code>, ... if
          there is more than one capture group):
        </p>

        <pre><code>git grep -l -E '(jingo|JINGO)' | xargs sed -i -E 's/(jingo|JINGO)/the framework formerly known as \1/g'</code></pre>

        <p>I hope that helps, happy refactoring!</p>
