          While working on a <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35894">Django ticket</a>, I found myself
          doing some git archeology and learned a new (to) me flag for <code>git log</code> which I thought I'd share.
        </p>
        <h2>The problem statement</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted to find commits that had removed or renamed a file inside a specific directory (<code>docs/</code> in
          this case).
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been doing git archeology for long enough that I know that when the problem statement starts with "I want
          to find a commit that ..." then the solution probably involves <code>git log</code> and this time was no
          different.
        </p>

        <p>
          None of my searches were turning up anything interesting, only solutions for "how to find the commit where
          file X was deleted", so I decided to read through the manual for <code>git log</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          After some trial and error involving <code>--stat</code> and <code>--dirstat</code>, I finally found what I
          wanted by looking for the word "deleted" inside the man page.
        </p>

        <h2>The solution: <code>--diff-filter</code></h2>

        <p>Here's the command I ended up with:</p>

        <pre><code>git log --diff-filter=RD --stat -- docs/</code></pre>

        <p>Some explanations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>git log</code> will list commits (all of them by default, in reverse order from newest to oldest);
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>--diff-filter=RD</code> will only list commits that either deleted (<code>D</code>) or renamed
            (<code>R</code>) a file;
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>--stat</code> will show some statistics on the commit, in that case showing which was was
            deleted/renamed;
          </li>
          <li>
            finally, <code>-- docs/</code> restricts the commits to those involving files inside the
            <code>docs/</code> directory.
          </li>
        </ul>
