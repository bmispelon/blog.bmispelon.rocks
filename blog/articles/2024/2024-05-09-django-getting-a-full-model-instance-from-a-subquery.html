          This one might be a bit niche, but it took me a bit of trial-and-error and I'm hoping that the technique I
          describe might be generic enough to be reusable. Who knows, if there's enough interest I could even turn it
          into a library!
        </p>

        <h2>Context</h2>

        <p>
          For a bit of context, my current <code>$DAY_JOB</code> involves a lot of converting hand-written SQL into an
          equivalent (or near enough) Django ORM version. In particular, I've been building a lot of
          <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/expressions/#subquery-expressions"
            ><code>Subquery</code> annotations</a
          >
          for querysets and I've come up with a useful technique that I wanted to share.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you've ever used the ORM's <code>Subquery</code> you might know that it's limited to returning a single
          column, but I've figured out a technique that lets me get full model instances out of a single subquery. In
          order for me to explain I think it's easier if I start small and build things up. So first things first, let's
          start with two convenient and somewhat realistic models:
        </p>

        <pre><code>from datetime import date

from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    rating = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
    published = models.DateField(default=date.today)


class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    birth = models.DateField(default=date.today)</code></pre>

        <p>
          For the sake of this example, let's say I want to get a queryset of <code>Person</code> instances, and for
          every person I want to get the most popular book published the year they were born. I know, I know, it's a
          little contrived but that's the best I could come up with, so please bear with me.
        </p>

        <h2>Attempt #1: Using <code>Subquery</code></h2>

        <p>
          For our first attempt, let's start by creating a custom queryset class for our <code>Person</code> model, with
          a custom <code>with_book()</code> method that annotates the queryset with the information we want:
        </p>

        <pre><code>from django.db.models.functions import ExtractYear

class PersonQuerySet(models.QuerySet):
    def with_book(self):
        """
        Annotate each person in the queryset with the best rated book of the
        year they were born.
        """
        year = ExtractYear(models.OuterRef("birth"))
        all_books = Book.objects.filter(published__year=year).order_by("-rating")
        best_book = models.Subquery(all_books.values("title")[:1])
        return self.annotate(book=best_book)


class Person(models.Model):
    ...  # same fields as before (name and birth)
    objects = PersonQuerySet.as_manager()</code></pre>

        <p>
          Now when we do <code>Person.objects.with_book()</code> each instance in the resulting queryset will have a
          <code>book</code> attribute containing the title of the best rated book published the year that person was
          born (or <code>None</code> if no books were published that year). That's a pretty standard use of
          <code>Subquery</code> so far, and it works great. But what if we wanted to get both the book's title
          <strong>AND</strong> its rating for example? If you're like me, you might try to simply add the extra field to
          the subquery, like so:
        </p>

        <pre><code>best_book = Subquery(all_books.values("title", "rating")[:1])</code></pre>

        <p>
          But unfortunately, that doesn't work. Django's <code>Suquery</code> can only deal with a single column as far
          as I can tell.
        </p>

        <h2>Attempt #2: JSON to the rescue</h2>

        <p>
          This is where I had my first <del>brilliant</del> devious idea. How do you turn two values into a single one?
          You stuff them both into a JSON object of course!
        </p>

        <pre><code>from django.db.models.functions import ExtractYear, JSONObject

class PersonQuerySet(models.QuerySet):
    def with_book(self):
        """
        Annotate each person in the queryset with the best rated book of the
        year they were born.
        """
        year = ExtractYear(models.OuterRef("birth"))
        all_books = Book.objects.filter(published__year=year).order_by("-rating")
        json_obj = JSONObject(title="title", rating="rating")
        best_book = models.Subquery(all_books.values_list(json_obj)[:1])
        return self.annotate(book=best_book)</code></pre>

        <p>
          Now all my <code>Person</code> instances are annotated with a <code>book</code> attribute that contains a
          dictionnary with two keys: <code>title</code> and <code>rating</code>. Amazing! But wait I hear you say, why
          stop only at those two fields? You can easily stuff <strong>everything</strong> in there, can't you?
        </p>

        <p>You sure can:</p>

        <pre><code>json_obj = models.JSONObject(id="id", title="title", rating="rating", published="published")</code></pre>

        <p>
          Works like a charm. Well for some definition of "charm" anyways. JSON only supports a limited number of types
          and in particular it does not do dates so our <code>published</code> field is returned as a string. That's
          annoying I guess, but not the end of the world right? Turns out that's fixable but it takes a bit of work,
          I'll get to it a bit later.
        </p>

        <p>
          For now, let's fix something that's easy. If you're like me you might have found it annoying having to list
          all the fields twice. There's gotta be a better way, and indeed that's where the <code>Model._meta</code> API
          comes to the rescue:
        </p>

        <pre><code>json_obj = JSONObject(**{f.name: f.name for f in Book._meta.get_fields()})</code></pre>

        <p>
          This has all the same limitations as before, but at least it's shorter and it's easily adatable to another
          model. But what if I told you we could do better? I did after all promise actual model instances in the intro,
          not just dictionaries.
        </p>

        <h2>Attempt #3: JSON + custom output field</h2>

        <p>
          I often think of the ORM (and various parts of Django actually) in terms of layers. One layer is my database
          with its tables, columns, and rows. At the other end there's the Django model layer with Python objects and
          attributes with rich data types. The trick then becomes finding the right class and the right methods that
          sits between those layers and that lets me convert things from one layer to another.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the ORM, this class is often the <code>models.Field</code> and its various subclasses. They're the ones
          who "know" how to convert from a database column type into an appropriate Python type. And if you've spent any
          time with Django's database functions you've probably had to sprinkle some
          <code>output_field=SomeDjangoModelField()</code> to get things working.
        </p>

        <p>
          And it turns out that <code>output_field</code> is the answer to our current problem as well. The idea is to
          create a custom field class that can convert the JSON object returned by the database (containing a key/value
          pair for each field of the model) into a model instance:
        </p>

        <pre><code>class BookJSONModelField(models.JSONField):
    """
    Instantiate an actual Book instance from a JSON object containing its fields.
    """
    def from_db_value(self, value, expression, connection):
        value = super().from_db_value(value, expression, connection)
        # at this point, value is a dict with one key/value pair per field
        return Book(**value)</code></pre>

        <p>With this new field, all we need to do is plug it in the <code>Subquery</code> call like so:</p>

        <pre><code>best_book = models.Subquery(all_books.values_list(json_obj)[:1], output_field=BookJSONModelField())</code></pre>

        <p>
          And voil√†, now our <code>book</code> annotation on the queryset gives actual model instances! Neat, right?
          There are still a few limitations though. The big one is that we still haven't solved the issue with JSON
          having a limited number of types: even though we do get a <code>Book</code> instance, if we look at
          <code>book.published</code> then we see it's still a string and not a date object.
        </p>

        <p>
          Luckily that's not too hard to solve. Remember when I said fields were the one that could convert between data
          types? Turns out all fields have a nifty <code>to_python()</code> method that will do the conversion for us:
        </p>

        <pre><code>def from_db_value(self, value, expression, connection):
    value = super().from_db_value(value, expression, connection)
    # at this point, value is a dict with one key/value pair per field
    return Book(**{k: Book._meta.get_field(k).to_python(v) for k, v in value.items()})</code></pre>

        <p>
          So there we have it. Just like I promised: a <code>Subquery</code> that returns actual model instances. I hope
          you found the journey interesting and that you learned something from it.
        </p>

        <h2>Possible further improvements</h2>

        <p>
          This technique is of course not perfect, and I'm not even sure it's very useful outside of some very specific
          situations (though if you do end up using it <a href="/about.html">please do let me know</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
          One feature that could be pretty neat would be to support <code>ForeignKey</code> fields via some kind of
          recursive JSON structure. I haven't tried to implement that but I think it should be doable without too much
          trouble (<em>famous last words</em>)
        </p>

        <p>
          It could also be cool to not have to load all the fields in the JSON object, and mark missing fields as
          <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/querysets/#defer">deferred</a> so they're loaded
          automatically from the db when accessed on the instance. I've actually implemented a proof of concept of this
          one and it was suprisingly easy (I've left it as an exercise to the reader üòÉ).
        </p>

        <p>What do you think? Is that something that would be worth packaging up into a 3rd-party library?</p>

        <hr />
