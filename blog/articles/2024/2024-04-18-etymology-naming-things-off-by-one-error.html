        <p>Have you ever heard of this programming joke?</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>- Why can't programmers tell Halloween and Christmas apart?</p>
          <p>- It's because they think <code>OCT31</code> is the same as <code>DEC25</code></p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Explaining the joke</h2>
        <p><small>Always a good sign when you have to explain the joke, isn't it?</small></p>

        <p>
          First off, in case that wasn't obvious: Halloween and Christmas are two holidays that take place on October
          31st and December 25th respectively.
        </p>

        <p>Next up, we have to talk about numbers. What are they and how do we write them down?</p>

        <p>
          A number is a quantity: how many fingers on a typical human hand, how many days in the month of January, how
          many times the word "pony" appears in the Django source code. To represent those numbers, most places in the
          world typically use a base ten system (also called decimal) where a number is written down using a sequence of
          one or more characters and where those characters are selected from <code>0123456789</code> (we call those
          "digits"). With this system, our numbers look like this: 10, 31, 235 (that's right, I counted them 🐴).
        </p>

        <p>
          The base 10 system is quite convenient for us humans and it's no big surprise. It's very likely that this
          system came to be because of the numbers of fingers most of us have (do you know what the Latin word for
          "finger" is? <em>digitus</em>). But other than that there's nothing so special about the number 10, and indeed
          there are times when other systems are more convenient. Another such system that's commonly used (especially
          with computers) is the base 8 one, also called <strong>octal</strong> (the Latin word for eight is
          <em>octō</em>, a root you might recognize from the word octopus 🐙).
        </p>

        <p>If you hadn't already understood the joke, maybe you start to see what's going on by now?</p>

        <p>
          I won't go into the mathematics too much here (if that's your thing, the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation">Wikipedia article</a> goes pretty deep on the
          subject), but for our purpose today just know that you can use Python's <code>int()</code> function to convert
          the representation of a number (<code>str</code>) in any base into an actual number (<code>int</code>).
        </p>

        <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; DEC25 = int("25", base=10)  # DEC for decimal = base 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; OCT31 = int("31", base=8)  # OCT for octal = base 8
&gt;&gt;&gt; DEC25 == OCT31
True</code></pre>

        <p>
          So yeah that's it. The joke is that the number twenty five is written as <code>25</code> in the decimal
          system, and as <code>31</code> in the octal system. Hilarious right? Isn't it a fun coincidence that the "dec"
          in "December" looks like the "dec" in "decimal", and that the same goes for "October" and "octal". Well as it
          turns out, it's no coincidence at all!
        </p>

        <h2>Month names</h2>

        <p>
          If you speak another European language there's a good chance that most english month names are familiar to
          you. This is because most languages in Europe (but far from all <a href="#footnote-non-latin-month">*</a>)
          inherited their month names from Latin. Just for fun I used
          <a href="https://gist.github.com/bmispelon/a203f65f9498bef6f997bf0d792126c8"
            >Django's translation machinery</a
          >
          to get a list of month names in a few different languages (well except for Latin since Django doesn't ship
          with a Latin translation ... yet?):

        <h2>A 2000 year old off-by-one error</h2>

        <p>
          Alright, so a bunch of European languages use basically the same sets of month names. If you're like me, you
          might find this interesting but I can also understand that it's not exactly mind-blowing. But look at the
          month names starting from September. Do you notice a weird pattern? Maybe it helps if I show you the numbers
          from 1 to 10 in Latin?
        </p>

        <p>Did that help? No? Well how about if I put those side-by-side with the months?</p>

        <p>
          Remember the joke that started this post? How "October" looked like "octal" and "December" like "decimal"?
          Well as it turns out that wasn't a coincidence at all. The name "September" literally means "month number 7",
          "October" is 8, "November" is 9 and "December" 10. To put it another way, the name of the 9th month of the
          calendar is "month #7", the 10th is #8, the 11th #9 and the 12th is #10. Lovely isn't it?
        </p>

        <p>
          What happened was that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar">old Roman calendar</a> used
          to have 10 months, with March being the first one. January and February were added later by a guy called
          Julius Caesar who even got a month named after him (and who ironically would probably
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar">not call March his number 1 month</a>).
          But when they added those new months they didn't really bother reindexing the names and so they kept them even
          though they now were off by two.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's often said that naming things and off-by-one errors are one of the hardest challenges with programming.
          Well here we have a great example where a naming issue left to an off-by-two error that's been in production
          for more than 2000 years. It puts things in perspective doesn't it?
