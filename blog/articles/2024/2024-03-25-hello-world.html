        <p>
          After several prototypes that went nowhere and literal years of thinking about it, I've finally launched my
          blog!
        </p>
        <p>
          All my previous attempts ended with me trying to build a complete (and complicated!) system up front. So this
          time I'm forcing myself to pick the simplest technology possible: a static site with handwritten HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          The layout isn't exactly how I'd want it, and some of the features I would have liked are still missing, but
          I'm trying really hard not to get distracted. It seems like it's a lot more fun to write a blog
          <em>engine</em> than a blog. I guess that's the programmer's curse.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the technical stuff (mostly) out of the way, now all that's left is to write articles. How hard could
          that be...
