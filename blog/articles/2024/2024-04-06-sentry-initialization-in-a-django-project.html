        <p>
          At <code>$DAYJOB</code> we use <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> to monitor errors in production. It
          works really well but our particular setup caused an annoyance that was surprisingly tricky to fix.
        </p>

        <h2>The annoyance</h2>
        <p>
          Following
          <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/django/#configure"
            >Sentry's official documentation</a
          >, we added the following code to our settings file:
        </p>

        <pre><code>import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init(...)  # credentials etc</code></pre>

        <p>
          This works perfectly fine, and once that snippet was in place error reports started showing up in the Sentry
          interface as they happened in production. So far so good.
        </p>

        <p>
          But after some time we started getting reports for some strange errors. Every once in a while, Sentry would
          start reporting exceptions like <code>SyntaxError</code> or <code>SystemExit</code>. What was going on?
        </p>

        <p>
          The answer was quite logical once I understood it, but it did take me by suprise. By putting the
          <code>sentry_sdk.init(...)</code> in our settings, it means that Sentry error reporting is active any time the
          project is loaded. That's a good thing overall as it means you catch a lot of potential problems, but there
          was once situation for us where that behavior was undesirable: the shell.
        </p>

        <p>
          These errors I was observing were the result of one of my coworkers starting a shell (<code
            >./manage.py shell</code
          >) on the server. If they made a typo, Python would throw a <code>SyntaxError</code> exception which would be
          diligently caught and reported by Sentry. The same thing also happened when they exited the shell, as Python
          then throws a <code>SystemExit</code> exception.
        </p>

        <p>
          At first it was pretty fun being able to tease my coworker about their typos, but it got annoying quite fast
          and I started looking into how to exclude the shell from Sentry's error reporting.
        </p>

        <h2>Attempt 1: a better entry point?</h2>

        <p>
          My first idea was to find a better place than <code>settings.py</code> where I could call
          <code>sentry_sdk.init()</code>. I figured there must be a file that gets loaded when running the website, but
          not when running a shell.
        </p>

        <p>After thinking about it for a while, I came up with 3 files that could be good candidates:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt><code>settings.py</code></dt>
          <dd>Our current solution (and the one recommended by the official docs).</dd>
          <dt><code>wsgi.py</code></dt>
          <dd>
            Created automatically by Django, this is the file that your webserver (<code>gunicorn</code>,
            <code>uwsgi</code>, ...) will load.
          </dd>
          <dt><code>manage.py</code></dt>
          <dd>
            This file is created automatically by Django when you start a project, and it's very rarely modified but it
            can be a nifty entry point.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          At first glance, <code>wsgi.py</code> seemed like a good entry point for what I wanted, but I quickly realized
          that it had a major drawback which ended up being a dealbreaker for me: Celery workers.
        </p>

        <p>
          As it turns out, there's more usecases to take into account than just web workers and management commands:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Web workers</dt>
          <dd>
            The main usecase for most Django projects I would guess (Django is a <em>web</em>framework after all).
          </dd>

          <dt>Management commands</dt>
          <dd>
            Your classic <code>./manage.py COMMAND</code> (<code>collectstatic</code>, <code>createsuperuser</code>,
            <code>migrate</code>, ...). Either called manually, or scheduled with something like CRON.
          </dd>

          <dt>Celery workers</dt>
          <dd>Or any kind of asynchronous task system. Most projects will have one when they reach a certain size.</dd>

          <dt>Random python scripts</dt>
          <dd>
            Probably not a good practice in general, but for some one-off tasks it's hard to beat the convenience of
            running a plain python script.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          3 entry points, 4 different uses cases. If my math is right, that's 12 different scenarios to consider (‚úÖ
          means the file is loaded, ‚ùå means it isn't):
        </p>

        </ul>

        <p>
          As we can see from the table above, there's not really a better entry point that would trigger with web and
          celery workers, but not with management commands or scripts. So we're back at square one üò©.
        </p>

        <h2>Attempt 2: detecting if we're running in a shell üêå</h2>

        <p>
          My second idea was to keep the initialization code in <code>settings.py</code>, but only execute it if we were
          not running in a shell. So how do you check which management command you're running? As is often the case,
          when I have a weird Django question there's a blog article by Adam Johnson that has exactly the answer I want.
          This time was no different:
          <a href="https://adamj.eu/tech/2020/05/14/how-to-check-the-running-django-command/"
            >How to Check the Running Django Command</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>So followings Adam's advice, here's what we end up with:</p>

        <pre><code>import sys
import sentry_sdk
...
if sys.argv[1:2] != ["shell"]:
    sentry_sdk.init(...)</code></pre>

        <p>Now we're getting somewhere!</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th><code>sys.argv[1:2] != ["shell"]</code></th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th>Web</th>
              <td>‚úÖ</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Celery worker</th>
              <td>‚úÖ</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th><code>./manage.py shell</code></th>
              <td>‚ùå</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Management command (anything else)</th>
              <td>‚úÖ</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Python script</th>
              <td>‚úÖ</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          We haven't reached perfection yet though. One issue for example is that some of my colleagues like to use the
          <code>shell_plus</code> command from
          <a href="https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shell_plus.html">django-extensions</a> instead of
          the plain <code>shell</code>. That means the <code>if</code> needs to be tweaked a bit. And what about other
          commands? I'm sure that as time goes by I will figure out that more commands need to be excluded and it could
          get annoying having to maintain a blocklist/allowlist.
        </p>

        <h2>Attempt 3?</h2>

        <p>
          To be honest I ended up sticking with option 2. It's not perfect, but the limitations seemed acceptable to me
          and it was a net improvement compared to what we had before.
        </p>
