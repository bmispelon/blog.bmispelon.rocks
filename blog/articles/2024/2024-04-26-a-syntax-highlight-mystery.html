          While writing some documentation for Django today, I noticed something that I thought was a bit weird inside
          one of the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/828b94b178736f7882cc6e5cd86b5c8e84b62ece/docs/intro/overview.txt#L73-L80"
            >code samples</a
          >. Can you spot it?
        </p>

        <pre><code>.. code-block:: pycon

    # Import the models we created from our "news" app
    &gt;&gt;&gt; from news.models import Article, Reporter

    # No reporters are in the system yet.
    >>> Reporter.objects.all()
    &lt;QuerySet []&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          I must have scrolled past that section a bunch of times and never noticed it, but once I saw it I couldn't
          un-see it and it really puzzled me.
        </p>

        <pre><code>.. code-block:: pycon</code></pre>

        <p>
          What's that <a href="https://pycon.org/">pycon</a> doing there? Surely whoever wrote that made a funny typo
          and meant to write <code>python</code>, right? What does a Python conference like Pycon have to do with syntax
          highlighting? I cobbled together some quick bash commands to count the usage of <code>pycon</code> vs.
          <code>python</code> in the docs, and to my <del>horror</del> suprise I got the following results:
        </p>

        <pre><code>$ git grep -Eo "code-block:: py(c|th)on" -- docs/ | cut -d: -f4 | sort | uniq -c
    959  pycon
    133  python</code></pre>

        <p>That's almost 10 times more <code>pycon</code>s than <code>python</code>s! What's going on here?</p>

        <p>
          Luckily I just happened to be in a
          <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/04/24/office-hours-on.html">zoom call with some smart people</a> at
          the time, and one of them quickly figured out that "pycon" stands for <strong>py</strong>thon
          <strong>con</strong>sole in that context. And indeed, all those code blocks using
          <code>code-block:: pycon</code> are examples of how things look like in a Python console, whereas
          <code>code-block:: python</code> is used for actual code samples (the ones you'd put in a
          <code>.py</code> file).
        </p>

        <p>
          The authoritative answer came from the documentation for pygments, the library that does the syntax
          highlighting under the hood. Their <a href="https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/">"Available lexers"</a> page
          conveniently lists all the languages it knows how to highlight, and a quick control-F on that page quickly
          reveals that <code>pycon</code> is indeed a "short name" for the <code>PythonConsoleLexer</code> which is
          used:
        </p>

        <blockquote cite="https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/#pygments.lexers.python.PythonConsoleLexer">
          For Python console output or doctests [...]
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>Mystery solved!</strong></p>

        <p>
          Even knowing what <code>pycon</code> is used for now, I still think it's not a great name as I believe most
          people would not associate it with "python console". So I quickly put together a
          <a href="https://github.com/pygments/pygments/pull/2697">PR for the pygments project</a> to add an alias for
          it (I picked <code>python-console</code>). If that PR is accepted, I plan to suggest switching to this alias
          in Django's documentation.
