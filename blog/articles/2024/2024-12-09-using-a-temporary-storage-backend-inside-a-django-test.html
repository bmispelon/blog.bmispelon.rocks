          Today I ran across an issue involving storages and staticfiles during tests. I was surprised not to find any
          quick solution online so here's my quick attempt at a solution. First the code, then some explanations:
        </p>
        <pre><code>import shutil
import tempfile


class TempDirMediaRootMixin:
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.tmpdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
        super().setUpClass()

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        super().tearDownClass()
        shutil.rmtree(cls.tmpdir, ignore_errors=True)

    def run(self, result=None):
        with self.settings(MEDIA_ROOT=self.tmpdir):
            return super().run(result)</code></pre>

        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>
          If you've ever worked with files in Django you're probably familiar with
          <code>settings.MEDIA_ROOT</code> which is the directory on your filesystem where Django will store uploaded
          files (assuming you're using the default <code>settings.STORAGES</code> and its
          <code>FileSystemStorage</code> backend).
        </p>

        <p>
          However, unlike other settings like <code>settings.DATABASES</code> or <code>settings.EMAIL_*</code> which are
          treated specially during tests (Django will run tests in a special test database, and will also send emails to
          a special in-memory email backend during tests), Django will happily reuse your
          <code>settings.MEDIA_ROOT</code> when running your tests.
        </p>

        <p>This created two problems for me:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Existing files in <code>MEDIA_ROOT</code> could interfere with the tests;</li>
          <li>
            Saving files during tests would clutter the <code>MEDIA_ROOT</code> directory and were not cleaned up after
            the tests were finished.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>My solution</h2>
        <p>
          Problem #1 can be solved by using a different <code>MEDIA_ROOT</code> when running tests. Maybe by using a
          value derived from an environment variable inside the settings file, or by using a different settings module
          for the tests. Either way, it's a bit annoying and requires modifications to the project's settings file, and
          maybe a bit of rearchitecturing of the infrastructure (like switching to multiple settings files).
        </p>

        <p>
          Problem #2 can be solved by manually deleting our test <code>MEDIA_ROOT</code> directory, but that can get
          annoying fast (and it's easy to forget).
        </p>

        <p>
          What if we could use a temporary directory for our tests, and have it be automatically cleaned once the test
          is over? Luckily Python has a nice builtin library for that:
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html">tempfile</a>!
        </p>

        <p>
          Calling <code>tempfile.mkdtemp()</code> returns the name of a directory on the filesystem with a random name
          (you can use the <code>prefix</code> and <code>suffix</code> arguments to customize the naming of the
          directory which can be useful when debugging). Once we have a name, all that's left is to tell Django to use
          that for <code>settings.MEDIA_ROOT</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is where
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase">unittest.TestCase</a>'s extension
          points come in handy. First, there's <code>setUpClass()</code>: this method will be called once per
          <code>TestCase</code> (sub)class at the beginning and so is the perfect place to initialize our temporary
          directory with <code>mkdtemp()</code>.
        </p>

        <pre><code>class TempDirMediaRootMixin:
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.tmpdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
        super().setUpClass()

    ...</code></pre>

        <p>
          Then there's the corresponding <code>tearDownClass()</code>: this method is also called once per (sub)class
          but this time at the end and so is the perfect place to have cleanup logic, in this case using
          <code>shutil.rmtree()</code> to delete our temporary directory.
        </p>

        <pre><code>class TempDirMediaRootMixin:
    ...

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        super().tearDownClass()
        shutil.rmtree(cls.tmpdir, ignore_errors=True)

    ...</code></pre>

        <p>
          Finally I needed a way to tell Django to use my temporary directory as a value for
          <code>settings.MEDIA_ROOT</code>. Normally you could decorate either a whole <code>TestCase</code> class or
          one of its methods with Django's
          <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/testing/tools/#django.test.override_settings"
            ><code>override_settings(MEDIA_ROOT=...)</code></a
          >
          but here we can't do that because the new value of <code>MEDIA_ROOT</code> is dynamic. That's why I opted to
          use the <code>run()</code> extension point since it allows me to wrap the execution of all the test methods of
          the class inside a context manager, conveniently using Django's
          <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/testing/tools/#django.test.SimpleTestCase.settings"
            ><code>self.settings()</code></a
          >.
        </p>

        <pre><code>class TempDirMediaRootMixin:
    ...

    def run(self, result=None):
        with self.settings(MEDIA_ROOT=self.tmpdir):
            return super().run(result)</code></pre>

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

        <p>
          One thing I don't like so much with this approach is that there's still some state shared between individual
          tests on the same test class. That could be fixed by clearing the temporary directory either before every test
          is run (<code>setUp()</code>) or after (<code>tearDown()</code>), but I would worry about performance (I
          haven't done any benchmarks though, so maybe that's not actually an issue ü§∑üèª).
        </p>

        <p>
          I also wonder if this is something that could/should be fixed in Django itself. I found it surprising that
          Django reused the project's <code>settings.STORAGES</code> during the tests. This is different from what
          happens with <code>settings.DATABASES</code> or <code>settings.EMAIL_BACKEND</code> where Django swaps the
          real backends with a different one when running tests. Not sure if there's already a ticket for that. If I
          ever run out of things to do on my open-source TODO list maybe I'll tackle that one üòÜ.
